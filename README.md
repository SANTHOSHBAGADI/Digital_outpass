# Digital_outpass
A web-based program called the Digital Outpass Management System was created to make it easier for students in educational institutions to request, approve, and track outpasses. There are four main roles involved:

Student: Creates an account in the system, submits approved outpass requests, and monitors the progress of such requests.
HOD (Head of Department): Manages student accounts (e.g., deletion), and approves or rejects requests for student registration and outpass (with remarks).
Security: Verifies authorized outpasses, records student check-in and check-out, and records these activities in an electronic log book.  
Admin: Maintains the digital log book, adds and removes entries every three months, and manages the HOD and Security accounts.
